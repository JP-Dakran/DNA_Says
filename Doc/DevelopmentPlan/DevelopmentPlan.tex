\section{Git Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
\item All issues will be posted in the issue tracker.
\item Descriptive commit messages should be used when committing in git. 
\item Milestones will be set, given a date of completion and posted on git for all group members to be aware of upcoming milestones.
\item Labels will be used to prioritize and organize issues and merge requests when needed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

\begin{itemize}
\item The implementation of this project should not be difficult, however the process of recording the sounds will be time consuming.
\item Testing should also not be difficult, as strings will be used and compared to test the addition of new moves to the previous pattern.
\item Pygame is required to develop this project. It is not hard to install if one knows which versions are compatible with the current version of Python (3.5).
\item This code will run on any platform that can run Python.
\item Testing with family and friends will play an integral role in determining the functionality of the program.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Overcoming Risks:}
With regards to compatibility issues, the latest pygame was released in 2009, which fortunately enough is compatible with the current Python version available. However Python releases a new update, it might not be compatible anymore. However, the option to download an older version of Python is available.

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Python will be used to develop this project.
\item It will run in its basic IDE Version 3.5.
\item Framework testing will be automated to test the different cases and outcomes of the game. Family and friends will test the overall functionality and performance of the game
\item LaTeX will be used to generate required documents.
\end{itemize}

\section{Coding Style}

\begin{itemize}
\item Descriptive variable names
\item Descriptive function names
\item Consistency in spacing
\begin{itemize}
\item Spaces before and after the operators
\item No spaces beside the brackets
\item One space to separate methods
\item Space before line comments
\item No spaces in between block comment and method
\end{itemize}
\item Comments
\begin{itemize}
\item Descriptive
\item Not too short of a sentence
\item Not everywhere, only when needed
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
