\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Video games have always been one of the top choices with regards to entertainment. They are also named as one of the great ways to help with boredom. This project is a redevelopment of the famous game Simon Says, with a slight modification that makes DNA Says unique while keeping the integrity of the game consistent with the original version. This interactive game is going to serve the purpose of allowing people of all ages, whether bored or simply having a break, to enjoy a fun and interactive game. The main basis of Simon Says is to remember a given pattern, and iterate it back. In addition, this project will aid in the enhancement of ones visual and auditory memory.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for this project is Dr. Spencer Smith - Professor of Software Engineer 3XA3 - Software Project Management at McMaster University.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are the general public who will operate the game DNA Says. A typical customer will be any person ranging from five years of age and older, who can operate and access a computer. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Development Team - Kareem, John-Paul, Shady
\item General Public
\item Previous and future developers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
Description: The game will be compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems.\\
\\
Rationale: The client will be using all of the operating systems listed above.\\
\\
Fit Criterion: During the user testing phase, all operating systems will be tested.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
This project will be a redevelopment of the game Simon Says - Python open source code available. The new game DNA Says will need to support the current games user platform.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The operating budget of the project is \$0. All resources needed to develop this game are currently owned by the developers.

\subsubsection{Scheduling Constraints}
The project must be fully completed: game completed, testing finished, and documentation complete by December 7, 2016.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
This game will be free and accessible to all users who have exposure to a computer.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}

Python will be used to develop this project. It will run in its basic IDLE Version 3.5. Framework testing will be automated to test the different cases and outcomes of the game. Family and friends will test the overall functionality and performance of the game. LaTeX will be used to generate required documents.\\
\\
The previous implementation of this game has approximately two hundred and fifty lines of code. This implementation only has one mode, however the version that will be implemented will have three different modes. Therefore the number of lines of code will be greater than the original version. The original implementation has no licenses that need to be acquired by the team or McMaster University.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that the user has basic understanding of operating a computer. The user must be able to open an application and follow simple instructions to interact with the GUI.\\
\\
It is also assumed that the users computer has enough processing speed and storage to effectively run and host the application.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
There are no major issues at this point of the course of the project. The only challenge that is being faced at the moment is analyzing the undocumented code, and determining the purpose of every line that is written.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
In general, there are many games that share the similar nature and purpose. However, with respect to Simon Says, there is the original oral game in which one designated person speaks out an action for the others to do, having them only do the action if they say ?Simon says? before it. As for digital versions, there exists multiple ones online.

\subsection{New Problems}
The only problem that could arise from this project is addiction. As there could be individuals that instead of enjoying this game during their free time or as a short break from their schedule, they would consume their other priorities? time to play. This game could potentially be the reason behind a missed deadline, or anything in that manner.

\subsection{Tasks}
All tasks that need to be accomplished are covered within this group?s Gantt Chart, including their start and end dates.

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{run:GanttChart.gan} {Gantt Chart}\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
There will not be issues transferring from another version of this game to this current version. Only the user?s preferences matter for this, and that will be discussed as a risk in the section below.

\subsection{Risks}
The user?s preferences are what will determine most of the success of this game. As it is designed based on the team?s preferences, it might conflict with what other individuals consider adequate. It could be that the colors used in the game are not appealing to some users. Also, the sounds that are used might not be preferred by some individuals.

\subsection{Costs}
There are no monetary costs included in this project.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
Instructions explaining the different modes and how the game is played will be available in the main menu which the user can access easily whenever desired.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
At this point, the analysis of the code will be conducted along with implementing the back-end of this project. A running prototype should be available for the Proof of Concept Demonstration.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
To make sure that most of the users will enjoy this game, a survey should be conducted to collect different thoughts and preferences as to what the users would like to see in this game, what they are looking forward to, and what they expect. That survey should include the desired colors, sounds, interface and functionality. Later, the implementation of this project should be modified to suit those preferences.
