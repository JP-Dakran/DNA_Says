\subsection{Parallelism}
In this subsection, tests will be conducted in parallel for existing implementation and our implemented version of the game.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Test \#18: User will launch both games }
\begin{itemize}
\item Test ID: FT-PAR-1
\item Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual 		
\item Initial State: Desktop on standby.					
\item Input: User launches both games, the existing implementation and recreated implementation. 	
\item Output: The existing game will open on main menu page which has brief game instructions and one button to start playing game, game has only one mode. In recreated implementation, main menu will open which has no instructions and 3 modes of play to choose from.
\item Execution: The tester will launch the game and observe that the two versions of the game have different menus and one has a single mode of play while the other has 3 modes of play.
\item Result: PASS!
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Test \#19: User will wait 5 seconds after pattern is played in both versions }
\begin{itemize}
\item Test ID: FT-PAR-2
\item Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual 		
\item Initial State: One of the three modes will be open, pattern will play					
\item Input: User does not repeat the pattern after it is played by the computer for 5 seconds	
\item Output: In existing implementation, game does not end and user can get back to the game to repeat the pattern at any time. In our implemented version, user has 4 seconds to start repeating the pattern otherwise level is failed				
\item Execution: The tester will open any of the modes and wait for pattern to be played, user will then wait for 5 seconds and observe response of the game, whether game ends or not.
\item Result: PASS!
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Test \#20: User will lose level on both implementations }
\begin{itemize}
\item Test ID: FT-PAR-3

\item Input: User enters incorrect pattern in both games.
\item Output: Both games end when wrong pattern is played and new pattern starts playing right away in both versions.			
\item Execution: The tester will play a wrong pattern to see whether game goes back to main menu or game just resets to level 1. In both versions game just restarts from level 1.
\item Result: PASS!
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}

\subsection{Look and Feel}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Test \#1: The product shall have an appealing colourful appearance.}

\item Initial State: Program installed onto system but not launched.		
\item Input: Launch program
\item Output: Menu page should have a colourful appearance.		
\item Execution: User launches the application and observes the menu's appearance, then the user satisfaction is recorded by the user.
\item Results: The average rating for appearance from user surveys was 8.2 out of 10, and several users left comments in the user survey about the simplicity and attractiveness of the design. These results imply a pass on this test.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Test \#2: The buttons must be well designed and coloured}
\begin{itemize}
\item Test ID: NFT-L2
\item Type: Structural, Dynamic, Manual			
\item Initial State: Application launched on main menu page.			
\item Input: User selects mode to play			
\item Output: Game starts in selected mode				
\item Execution: User presses buttons on menu and again in mode selected to follow pattern, satisfaction regarding button appearance is recorded by the user. Test is succesful if buttons are all same shape in JP and Shady modes and if they are in a piano format in Karim mode. Buttons all be different colours in JP and Shady modes, and white and black in Karim mode.
\item Results: The average rating for appearance in the user survey was 8.2 out of 10. The buttons are a part of the appearance. No specific positive or negative comments were made on the buttons so that is a pass for this test. Buttons are all the same shape but different colours in JP and Shady modes and buttons form a piano design in black and white colours in Karim mode. Therefore test is passed.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Test \#3: The product shall have attractive sound patterns. The associated sounds with buttons must be well constructed and notes must follow harmonically.}

\end{itemize}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

\par The core functionality of DNA Says relies on the original game Simon Says. However, the implementation is vastly different to preserve originality and creativity. The main principle of having the computer play a specific pattern and having the user repeat it is evident in both implementations. It is how the pattern is presented that is modified in DNA Says, rather than having one mode that contains only four buttons. This is what makes DNA Says unique. 
\\
\par DNA Says contains three modes, compared to one, which are Kareem Says, JP Says and Shady Says. In Kareem Says, the user is presented a piano keyboard in which the pattern will be played on, both by the computer and the user. Of course, the colors of the keys match those of a real piano, and each key is assigned one unique tone. When a key is clicked, if it is correct then it will light up in red to indicate the selection and its tone will play. Otherwise, the whole window will flash to indicate the entry of a wrong key and losing the game and a harmonic combination of tones will play. This wil then reset back to level one, and the score to zero.
\\
\par As for JP Says, there are nine buttons of different colors, arranged as a three-by-three grid in the middle of the screen. Each button is assigned a unique tone that is played every time the button is pressed. To advance with this mode, the user must repeat the pattern that is played by the computer. The pattern is incremented by one element for every level. The new element that is added is completely random every time. Winning and losing conditions follow those of Kareem Says.
\\
\par Finally, Shady Says. There are four buttons of different colors, arranged as a two-by-two grid in the middle of the screen. For every time that any button is pressed, a completely random tone (out of four in total) will play. To advance with this mode, the user must repeat the pattern that is played by the computer. The pattern is incremented by one element for every level. The new element that is added is completely random every time. Winning and losing conditions follow those of Kareem Says.


\section{Unit Testing}

\par The program was split up into modules, each to be tested separately. This unit testing ensured that changes made to the game did not break the basic functionality of the game. The testing conducted is detailed below.

\item{Initial State: any screen is displayed}
\item{Input: checkForQuit() is invoked}
\item{Output: the program terminates}
\item{Result: PASS!}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\par The program does not produce any output files. Unit testing is therefore not applicable for output files in this project.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf {Note Release Time}
\par After playing the game, it was decided that the release time of the notes should be increased. The piano notes then were re-recorded to accommodate that decision.


\item \textbf {Button Colors in JP Says}
\par Rather than having different shades of a single color present, the team decided to follow a systematic order. It was decided that it would be best to have all seven colors of the rainbow present, along with black and white to have nine visually distinguishable colors/shades to use.

\item \textbf {Back Button}
\par After conducting the survey, it was agreed upon that the back button did not look elegant. Several individuals had suggested to simply display the word “Back” on the button rather than the left-pointing arrow.

\item \textbf {Redisplaying Text on Screen}
\par As the level changed (incremented or decremented), the text on the screen now flickers to indicate that change along with the change of colors in the background.

\item \textbf {Endless Playing}
\par The game has been changed to be able to reach an infinite level number. The user can continuously play until they lose or choose to stop playing for any circumstances. In addition, the song pattern in Kareem Says has been implemented in a way where the song will loop to the beginning uninterruptedly to accommodate that change.
\end{itemize}

\section{Automated Testing}

\par Generally, automated testing is not the most effective with games as there has not been a fixed artificial intelligence implementation that can mimic a human being’s behaviour exactly. However, as a team, automated testing was made a possibility (to an extent). For all three modes, a random selection algorithm was implemented to select a random button to play back to the computer after it displayed the pattern, that is biased towards picking the correct button. This can somewhat identify with the behaviour of a child playing this game. Another short algorithm was developed to then analyze the given input at every level and compare it to the pattern that the computer played. If it matched exactly then the test would advance to the next level. Otherwise, the mode resets back to level one.
\\
\par This program produces no output files and therefore automated testing for output files is not applicable.

		
\section{Trace to Requirements}
		
\section{Trace to Modules}		

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

\par As an estimate, all tests including manual, automated and unit testing have covered ninety-five percent of the code written in the source file. Each method/module has been tested separately as well as coupled with other appropriate modules. This estimate holds true as all modules have been tested thoroughly with various inputs when applicable, and now the output of all remains correct as expected. Please refer to the Automated Testing and Unit Testing sections above to further validate the coverage rate estimate.
