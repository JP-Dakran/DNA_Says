\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Video games have always been one of the top choices with regards to entertainment. They are also named as one of the great ways to overcome boredom. This project is a redevelopment of the famous digital game Simon Says, with a slight modification that makes DNA Says unique while keeping the integrity of the game consistent with the original version. This interactive game serves the purpose of allowing people of all ages, whether bored or simply having a break, to enjoy a fun and an interactive game. The main basis of Simon Says is to remember a given pattern, and iterate it back. In addition, this project will aid in the enhancement of ones visual and auditory memory.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
This pogram is developped as the final project for McMaster University's Software Engineer 3XA3 - Software Project Management. Therefore, the client for this project is Dr. Spencer Smith, the  Professor of  that course.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are the general public who will operate the game DNA Says. A typical customer will be any person ranging from five years of age and older, who can access and operate a computer. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Development Team - Kareem, John-Paul and Shady.
\item Previous and future developers as they possess the power to modify and publish this program as they desire.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
Description: This game is OS independant. It is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems.\\
\\
Rationale: The client will be using any of the operating systems listed above.\\
\\
Fit Criterion: During the user testing phase, all of the operating systems mentioned above were tested.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
This project is a redevelopment of the digital game Simon Says in which its Python open source code is available online. The new game DNA Says supports the current game's user platform.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The operating budget of the project is \$0. All resources needed to develop this game are currently owned by the developers.

\subsubsection{Scheduling Constraints}
The project must be fully completed by December 7, 2016. This includes the implementation, testing and documentation.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
This game is free and accessible to all users who have exposure to a computer.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}

Python is used to develop this project. It runs in its basic IDLE Version 3.5. Framework is tested in an automated fashion to validate the different cases and outcomes of the game. Family and friends have tested the overall functionality and performance of the game, as well as its non-functional requirements. LaTeX is to generate required documents.\\
\\
The previous implementation of this game has approximately two hundred and fifty lines of code. That implementation only has one mode, however the version implemented has three different modes and a menu. Therefore the number of lines of code is greater than the original version's. The original implementation has no licenses that need to be acquired by the team or McMaster University.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that the user has downloaded any version of Python along with its corresponding Pygame version.
\\
It is also assumed that the user has basic understanding of operating a computer. The user must be able to open an application and follow simple instructions to interact with the GUI.\\
\\
Finally, the user's computer must have enough processing speed and storage to effectively run and host the application.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
There has been no open issues in the duration of this project. The undocumented code has been carefully anlyzed and each line has been assessed and a solid understanding of the program has been gained.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
In general, there are many games that share the similar nature and purpose. However, with respect to Simon Says, there is the original oral game in which one designated person speaks out an action for the others to do, having them only do the action if they say ?Simon says? before it. As for digital versions, there exists multiple ones online.

\subsection{New Problems}
The only problem that could arise from this project is addiction. As there could be individuals that instead of enjoying this game during their free time or as a short break from their schedule, they would consume their other priorities? time to play. This game could potentially be the reason behind a missed deadline, or anything in that manner.

\subsection{Tasks}
All tasks that need to be accomplished are covered within this group's Gantt Chart, including their start and end dates found here:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{run:GanttChart.gan} {Gantt Chart}\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
There will not be issues transferring from another version of this game to this current version. Only the user's preferences matter for this, and that will be discussed as a risk in the section below.

\subsection{Risks}
The initial risk has been that the user's preferences might conflict with the team's preferences that the game was built upon. That risk has been taken into consideration and to counter it, the team has developed a user survey. That survey was taken by various users that played the game and their opinions were analyzed and the game has been updated accordingly.

\subsection{Costs}
There are no monetary costs included in this project.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
Instructions are always available at the bottom left corner of the screen. The game is very simple and does not require more than one line of explanation per mode.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
At this point, the team is improving all documentation for the next round of marking.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
To make sure that most of the users will enjoy this game, a survey was conducted to collect different thoughts and preferences as to what the users would like to see in this game, what they are looking forward to, and what they expect. That survey included the desired colors, sounds, interface and functionality. The current implementation of this project is modified to suit those preferences.
