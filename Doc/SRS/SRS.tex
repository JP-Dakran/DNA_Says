\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Video games have always been one of the top choices with regards to entertainment. They are also named as one of the great ways to help with boredom. This project is a redevelop of the famous game Simon Says, with a slight modification that makes DNA Says unique while keeping the integrity of the game consistent with the original version. This interactive game is going to serve the purpose of allowing people of all ages, whether bored or simply having a break, to enjoy a fun and interactive game. The main basis of Simon Says is to remember a given pattern, and iterate it back. In addition, this project will aid in the enhancement of ones visual and auditory memory.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for this project is Dr. Spencer Smith - Professor of Software Engineer 3XA3 - Software Project Management at McMaster University.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are the general public who will operate the game DNA Says. A typical customer will be any person ranging from 5 years of age and older - who can operate and access a computer. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Development Team - Karim, John-Paul, Shady
\item General Public
\item Previous and future developers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
Description: The game will be compatible with Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux operating systems.\\
\\
Rationale: The client will be using all of the operating systems listed above.\\
\\
Fit Criterion: During the user testing phase, all operating systems will be tested.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
This project will be a redevelopment of the game Simon Says - Python open source code available. The new game DNA Says will need to support the current games user platform.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The operating budget of the project is \$0. All resources needed to develop this game are currently owned by the developers.

\subsubsection{Scheduling Constraints}
The project must be fully completed - game completed, testing finished, and documentation complete - by December 8, 2016.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
This game will be free and accessible to all users who have exposure to a computer. 

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

		\label{tab:table3}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			\hline
			Term & Definiton\\
			\hline
			Windows & An operating system.\\
			Mac OSX & An operating system.\\
			Linux & An operating system.\\
			Python & A programming language.\\
			IDLE & Integrated Development Environment\\
			LaTeX & A document preparation system. \\
			Mode & Different subsections of the game.\\
			GUI & Graphical user interface.\\
			Gantt Chart &Chart outlining the timeline of the project.\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}



\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}

Python will be used to develop this project. It will run in its basic IDLE Version 3.5. Framework testing will be automated to test the different cases and outcomes of the game. Family and friends will test the overall functionality and performance of the game. LaTeX will be used to generate required documents.\\
\\
The previous implementation of this game has approximately 250 lines of code. This implementation only has one mode, however the version we will be implementing has 3 different modes. Therefore the number of lines of code will be greater than the original version. The original implementation has no licenses that need to be acquired by the team or McMaster University.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that the user has basic understanding of operating a computer. The user must be able to open an application and follow simple instructions to interact with the GUI.\\
\\
It is also assumed that the users computer has enough processing speed and storage to effectively run and host the application.
